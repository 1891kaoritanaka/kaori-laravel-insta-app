Admin and Regular User

Admin button - hidden from the regular users
            - show/displayed to the Admin users

middleware -> we will use the middleware to separate the Admin from the regular users

What is a middleware? -> a mechanism that act like a filter for the HTTP request

ex: John Smith --> login page [username, password]  [Middleware::Auth] ---> Grant Access/Denied

If Users --- role_id == 1 ? Grant Access to the Admin (Admin button)
If not equal to 1, denied access to Admin/hide the Admin button

Gate --- It determines wethere to give access or block access

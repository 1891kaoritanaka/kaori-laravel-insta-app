Goal: Build an additional feature to the Laravel-Insta App
Feature: Simple Chat Message (Chat Box)

A. The logged-in user (AUTH User) can send message to the user that he is following.
B. The other user, can also reply to the message

Steps/Hint
1. Create the .blade.php file (Example: index.blade.php, chats.blade.php)
2. Create the migration -- for table (chats)
3. Create the model of the migration ---Chat.php
4. Create the ChatController.php
5. Note: Make sure that you create a method relationship between User.php and Chat.php so that the two models will be connected, when they are connected, the User can easily retrieve the message from the Chat.php model.

Note: You have to save the message in the chats table
| In chats table, there should be sender id (=user_id), receiver_id, message, timestamps
